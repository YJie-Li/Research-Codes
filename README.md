Paper title: Application of novel multi-source information fusion model for coal and gas outburst prediction.
Authors: Yingjie Li, Yongguo Yang, Bo Jiang.
Codes description: The codes contain five steps. The first step computes the distance between two BPAs, which measures the distance not only from the perspective of dissimilarity but also from consistency. The second step deduces supporting degree among evidence based on the distance. Then, in the third step, the evidence source is modified by their weight. The fourth step clusters the modified evidence source by agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and finally in the last step, we execute the convergence according to different clusters. The experiment was performed using MATLABÂ® R2016a software and note that the format of the data should be set according to the comments in the code.
